Sometimes you need a place where you can save those notes that are neither
important enough to justify a repository on [github](http://github.com) nor
simple enough to be just forgotten. For these cases there is nothing better
than a blog... so here we go. :)

As I'm intended to write most of the time only small pieces of code and its
relevant comments, I decided to use [octopress](http://octopress.org) since
it allows me to create new posts using [vim](http://www.vim.org) and publish
them with one single command.
